# Nile Milk Fix

## What it does

Fixes a bug where milk would remove beneficial status effects upon use.

## Rotten mix
To compensate for the removed functionality, a new item, 'Rotten Mix' is crafted with rotten flesh, a spider eye and a slimeball. It acts as the old milk, removing all status effects upon use.
